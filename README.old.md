# nasa-movies-webapp

## Instructions:

1. Replicate the existing NASA site: https://nasa-movies.netlify.app/

- NASA API KEY: Using the Netlify link above, I want you to find the NASA API

- TMDB API KEY: Using the Netlify link above, I want you to find the TMDB API

2. Spin up a new react project by using create react app CLI

# Rules:

- Don’t reinvent the wheel

- If you have a preferred CSS library or UI framework, please use them!

- Commit often

- I want to see how you work

- I want to see clear commit messages

- Feel free to use your imagination but try not to deviate too much from the FUNCTIONALITY of the example site

- The Movie Detail Page is intentionally generically styled

- You can clean up the presentation but don’t spend too much time on bells and whistles

- Making it easier to read is the goal

- There are intentional bugs, so please point them out and propose a solution

- As discussed, if you don’t find a bug, that’s ok!
